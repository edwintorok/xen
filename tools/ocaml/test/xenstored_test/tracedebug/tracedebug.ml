(* Implementation constraints:

   - has to build on OCaml 4.02.3+, no dependencies on libraries not shipped with it
   - can optionally use functionality provided by newer versions or external libraries by using
     dune's select mechanism (in separate modules)
   - Minimize memory allocation and CPU usage during normal operation
   - Limit maximum memory usage so that tracing can be left enabled for long running tests
   - Dump a debug trace when an error/exception is encountered, this one can be a slowpath
