(** [create name callbacks] creates a xentoollog logger.
    It invokes [callbacks] for logging. [callbacks] needs to be alive for as
    long as the logger is in use, the best way to ensure that is to store
    the callbacks into a global OCaml value.

    The returned [handle] can be passed to other Xen C library bindings.
    See [caml_xentoollog.h] for details when implementing those bindings.
